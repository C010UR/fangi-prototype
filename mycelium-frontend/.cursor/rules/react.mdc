# React Best Practices

You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, Vite, React, Tanstack Query, Tanstack Router, Zod, Zustand, Shadcn UI, Tailwind.

## Component Structure
- Use functional components over class components
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop types with TypeScript
- Split large components into smaller, focused ones

## Hooks
- Follow the Rules of Hooks
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep hooks focused and simple
- Use appropriate dependency arrays in useEffect
- Implement cleanup in useEffect when needed
- Avoid nested hooks

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Implement useReducer for complex state logic
- Use Context API for shared state
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Avoid prop drilling through proper state management
- Use state management libraries only when necessary

## Performance
- Implement proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use proper key props in lists
- Profile and optimize render performance

## Forms
- Use controlled components for form inputs
- Implement proper form validation
- Handle form submission states properly
- Show appropriate loading and error states
- Use form libraries for complex forms
- Implement proper accessibility for forms

## Error Handling
- Implement Error Boundaries
- Handle async errors properly
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper fallback UI
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Testing
- Write unit tests for components
- Implement integration tests for complex flows
- Use React Testing Library
- Test user interactions
- Test error scenarios
- Implement proper mock data

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Handle focus management
- Provide proper alt text for images

## Code Organization
- Group related components together
- Use proper file naming conventions
- Implement proper directory structure
- Keep styles close to components
- Use proper imports/exports
- Document complex component logic 

# Shadcn UI Components

This project uses @shadcn/ui for UI components. These are beautifully designed, accessible components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Finding and Using Components

Components are available in the `src/components/ui` directory, following the aliases configured in `components.json`

## Using Components

Import components from the ui directory using the configured aliases:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs"
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

Example usage:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Component Styling

This project uses the "new-york" style variant with the "neutral" base color and CSS variables for theming, as configured in `components.json`.

# Type Validation with Zod

You are an expert TypeScript developer who understands that type assertions (using `as`) only provide compile-time safety without runtime validation.

## Zod Over Type Assertions

- **NEVER** use type assertions (with `as`) for external data sources, API responses, or user inputs
- **ALWAYS** use Zod schemas to validate and parse data from external sources
- Implement proper error handling for validation failures

## Zod Implementation Patterns

- Import zod with: `import { z } from 'zod'`
- Define schemas near related types or in dedicated schema files
- Use `schema.parse()` for throwing validation behavior
- Use `schema.safeParse()` for non-throwing validation with detailed errors
- Add meaningful error messages with `.refine()` and `.superRefine()`
- Set up default values with `.default()` when appropriate
- Use transformations with `.transform()` to convert data formats
- Always handle potential validation errors

## State Management

- Use Zustand for global state management.
- Lift state up when needed to share state between components.
- Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome.
